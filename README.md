## Project Description

## Project Goals

The goals of this project are to analyze the relationships between
various world development indicators across the years for all countries.
We hope to gain more insight into factors that affect the quality of
life in a country as well as how countries have developed through the
past few decades.

## Dataset Information

The World Bank DataBank contains time series data on many different
topics for each country in the world. The World Development Indicators
dataset contains metrics about global development through various themes
(e.g.Â poverty and inequality, people, environment, economy, states and
markets, and global links). The data is compiled from
officially-recognized international sources and contains 1,400 time
series indicators for 217 economies and more than 40 country groups,
with data for many indicators going back more than 50 years.
